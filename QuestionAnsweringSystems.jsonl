{"q": " What is Question-Answering (QA) systems and what is their main objective?", "a": "Question-Answering (QA) systems are designed to retrieve suitable answers to given questions in text passages. Their main objective is to provide relevant information to users by extracting it from large volumes of thematic data using various design approaches such as Extractive QA (Retriever + Database + Reader), Open Generative QA (Generator + Database), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Retriever + Generator), or Closed Generative QA (Generator + Vector Database). The choice between these architectures depends on factors such as specific requirements for short or exact answers or longer and more generic information for open questions in different domains or knowledge domains. The most popular vector databases for efficient storage and search among embeddings based on their similarity include Faiss, Pinecone, and Chroma. The ultimate retrieved context is constructed from more relevant documents in most cases using these architectures to improve search efficiency while maintaining accuracy in answering questions accurately."}
{"q": " What are the three main design approaches for building modern and scalable QA applications?", "a": "The three main design approaches for building modern and scalable QA applications are:\n\n1. Extractive QA:\n   - Consists of three components:\n     - Retriever (to return an embedding corresponding to the question)\n     - Database (to store corresponding embeddings to documents)\n     - Reader (to find most similar vectors among an external collection of documents)\n   - Uses language models like Transformers to build dense embeddings that capture semantic meaning.\n   - Vector databases like Faiss or Pinecone provide efficient storage and search among embeddings based on their similarity.\n\n2. Open Generative QA:\n   - Uses generative models like GPT for generating answers.\n   - Similar to Extractive QA but with direct access to text passages containing relative information.\n   - Uses generative models to generate answers based on information provided in the question.\n\n3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\n   - A framework for creating LLM applications whose architecture is based on Open Generative QA systems.\n   - Uses RAG retriever to identify most relevant knowledge domain to a given query.\n   - Depending on an identified domain, vector databases or knowledge domains can be used to retrieve most relevant information for the query.\n   - This technique makes search process faster as it searches through only a particular subset of documents (instead of all documents) and can make search more reliable as it constructs answers from more relevant documents.\n\nAll three approaches have their own pros and cons depending on the specific use case or domain. It is necessary to analyze input problems to choose the correct QA architecture type for better performance."}
{"q": " What are the three main components in an Extractive QA system architecture?", "a": "The three main components in an Extractive QA system architecture are:\n\n1. Retriever - responsible for returning an embedding corresponding to the given question.\n2. Database - stores the most similar vectors among an external collection of documents.\n3. Reader - extracts an answer from these documents based on their similarity to the query vector.\n\nThese components work together to retrieve an appropriate response to a given query in an Extractive QA system architecture."}
{"q": " What is Open Generative QA?", "a": "Open Generative QA is an architecture for building Question-Answering systems where an Open Generative model generates an answer based on information provided in both the question and text passages. Unlike Extractive QA where a reader model retrieves an exact or precise answer from text passages containing relative information, Open Generative QA systems use generative models like GPT to generate longer and more generic information for given contexts while still maintaining precision in answering specific questions accurately. The main advantage of Open Generative QA is that it reduces pipeline time by not requiring access to external information but comes with challenges such as training robust generators on large datasets due to resource-heavy training requirements for large models like GPTs. Closed Generative QA is used for specific domains with generic questions while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging trend in machine learning where LLMs work with several knowledge domains to identify relevant domains for specific queries before retrieving information from vector databases within those domains to improve search efficiency and reliability in cases where short or exact answers are expected."}
{"q": " What is Extractive QA?", "a": "Extractive QA systems consist of three components:\n\n1. Retriever - responsible for returning an embedding corresponding to the question.\n2. Database - stores corresponding embeddings to documents.\n3. Reader - extracts an answer from these embeddings based on their similarity to the query vector.\n\nIn these systems, vector databases usually play the role of a component for efficient storage and search among embeddings based on their similarity.\n\nExtractive QA architecture:\n\n1. The question is fed into the retriever.\n2. The goal of the retriever is to return an embedding corresponding to the question.\n3. After obtaining an embedding from a query (usually using Transformer-like models like BERT), it is then used to find the most similar vectors among an external collection of documents.\n4. Each document has a certain chance of containing the answer to the question.\n5. The collection of documents is processed during training by being passed to the retriever which outputs corresponding embeddings to them.\n6. These embeddings are then stored in a database which can provide an effective search.\n7. If you would like to better understand how vector databases work under the hood, then I recommend you check my article series on similarity search where I deeply cover the most popular algorithms.\n\nIf you would like to know more about specific architectures or techniques used in Extractive QA systems, I recommend checking out my article series on similarity search or reaching out to me directly for more information."}
{"q": " How does Open Generative QA differ from Extractive QA in terms of answer generation?", "a": "Open Generative QA differs from Extractive QA in terms of answer generation in that Open Generative QA systems use generative models like GPT for generating answers instead of extracting them from text passages using readers like in Extractive QA systems. In Open Generative QA systems, the generator does not directly extract answers from text passages but generates them from information provided in the question and text passages using relative information from both components to generate appropriate answers for each context. In contrast, Extractive QA systems use readers to extract answers from text passages directly based on word frequency in questions or text passages."}
{"q": " What is the main advantage of closed generative QA systems compared to open generative QA systems?", "a": "The main advantage of closed generative QA systems compared to open generative QA systems is that closed systems do not have access to any external information and generate answers by only using the information from the question itself, while open systems use generative models like GPT to generate answers from external information as well as internal information in text passages. Closed systems have reduced pipeline time but come with training and accuracy costs; open systems have simpler training requirements but may have lower accuracy due to limited training data. Both approaches have their own pros and cons depending on the specific problem domain."}
{"q": " Can closed generative QA systems access external information during their generation process?", "a": "No, closed generative QA systems cannot access external information during their generation process as they do not have access to any external information and generate answers solely using the information provided in their input (the question). They rely solely on their internal knowledge stored in their generator model to generate an appropriate response to the given input."}
{"q": " What are some advantages and disadvantages associated with closed generative QA pipelines compared to extractive and open generative QA pipelines?", "a": "Advantages:\n1. Reduced pipeline time as closed generative QA systems do not have to search through large collections of external documents.\n2. Robustness as closed generative QA systems generate answers by only using information from the question.\n3. Generators do not know any information that appeared later in the data they had been trained on.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Training closed generative QA systems can be resource-heavy due to their large training knowledge.\n2. Generators do not know any information that appeared later in the data they had been trained on.\n3. Closed generative QA pipelines have no access to external information for generating answers.\n4. Performance tends to degrade in closed generative QA systems for specific domains due to their lack of external knowledge.\n5. Training closed generative QA systems again on more recent data can be resource-intensive for large datasets.\n6.
